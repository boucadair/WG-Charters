# Charter

The DNSOP WG defines and documents the deployment and operational considerations for the DNS protocol. The WG also provides guidance and elaborates best current practices for DNS deployment.

DNSOP provides a venue for DNS operators and other interested parties to engage in discussions around the operational requirements of DNS. Specifically, the WG welcomes insights from those who wish to share operational experience and challenges as well as discuss other DNS-related matters that are within scope of the working group.

The DNSOP WG is also responsible for maintenance, updates, and extensions to the DNS protocol as well as other narrowly-scoped, DNS related documents.

The WG will engage with relevant WGs and other appropriate organisations whenever collaboration is needed. DNSOP will liaise with IANA on the management of IANA's DNS-related registries.

# Discussion for the WG

The protocol maintenance work might be offloaded to a dedicated WG, likely in the INT area, so that DNSOPS focuses on operational matters. Such split might be considered when DELEG has finished it work. A WG rechartering might be considered in due time.

Do we need mention that plan in the Charter itself or not?
