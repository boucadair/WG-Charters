# Charter

The Domain Name System Operations (DNSOP) WG  defines and documents the deployment and operational considerations for the DNS protocol. The WG also provides guidance and elaborates best current practices for DNS deployment. DNS topics which are being developed in other IETF WGs are out of scope for the DNSOP WG.

DNSOP provides a venue for DNS operators and other interested parties to engage in discussions around the operational requirements of DNS and publish documents. Specifically, the WG welcomes insights from those who wish to share operational experience and challenges as well as discuss other DNS-related matters that are within scope of the WG.

The DNSOP WG is also responsible for maintenance, updates and extensions to the DNS protocol.

DNS-related I-Ds that don't have an obvious WG which could adopt them can be submitted to the DNSOP WG for consideration. The DNSOP WG will advise on the appropriate way to progress these I-Ds, for instance by suggesting the most suitable WG or recommending the chartering of a new WG.

The WG will engage with relevant WGs and other appropriate organizations whenever collaboration is needed, especially for WG adoption and Last Calls. DNSOP will liaise with IANA on the management of IANA's DNS-related registries.

# Discussion for the WG

The protocol maintenance work might be offloaded to a dedicated WG, likely in the INT area, so that DNSOPS focuses on operational matters. Such split might be considered when DELEG has finished it work. A WG rechartering might be considered in due time.

Do we need mention that plan in the Charter itself or not?
