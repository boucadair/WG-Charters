The DNS Operations Working Group will develop guidelines for the
operation of DNS software and services and for the administration
of DNS zones. These guidelines will provide technical information
relating to the implementation of the DNS protocol by the operators
and administrators of DNS zones. The group will perform the following
activities:

1. Describe practices by which Domain Name System (DNS) software
may be efficiently and correctly administered, configured, and
operated on Internet networks. This will include root zone name
servers, TLD name servers, or any other resolver or server
functioning as part of the global DNS. As part of this effort,
the group will produce documents explaining to the general
Internet community what processes and mechanisms should be
employed for the effective management and operation of DNS
software and services, including root, TLD, and recursive servers.

2. Publish documents concerning DNSSEC operational procedures.

3. Publish documents concerning DNS operational
procedures in IPv6 and mixed IPv6-IPv4 networks, and provide
documentation and guidance on DNS-related IPv6 transition and
coexistence issues.

4. Publish documents to address operational issues with the DNS
protocols by extending or performing protocol maintenance
on them. Act as focal-point for operator discussion and provide
advice to the Ops ADs and other WGs on EDNS0 options, new
RRTYPEs, DNSSEC, record synthesis, or other mechanics of
extending DNS to support other applications.

5. Serve as a home for drafts that document the problem space
around existing or new DNS issues. The group, with the advice
and consent of the responsible AD in coordination with other areas,
will then decide whether these issues belong in DNSOP under
the existing charter and, if not, will work with the authors and
appropriate ADs to determine the proper place for the work to be
carried out.

6. Publish documents that attempt to better define the overlapping
area among the public DNS root, DNS-like names as used in local
or restricted naming scopes, and the 'special names' registry
that IETF manages, perhaps including how they might interact.
This work must take into consideration issues that are strictly
beyond the operation of the DNS itself, and the working group
will consult with IETF liaisons to other organizations as
appropriate.
