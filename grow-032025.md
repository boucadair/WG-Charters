The purpose of the GROW working group is to consider the operational problems
associated with the global IP routing system (both IPv4 and IPv6), including
but not limited to default-free zone routing table growth, forwarding tables
growth, effects of the interactions between interior and exterior routing protocols,
and effects of IPv4/IPv6 address allocation policies on the global routing system. 

The working group will document the operational aspects of measurement, monitoring,
policy, operational global routing system security, VPN infrastructures, or safe
default behavior of global IP routing protocol implementations and deployments.
The GROW working group will also increase awareness to mitigations to prevent
malpractice (e.g., route leaks) in the global routing system.

The GROW working group will develop data models and building blocks
for automating the operation of the global routing system.

The GROW working group will advise other working groups, mainly IDR,
with respect to whether they are addressing the relevant operational and
routing security requirements of Internet-connected networks, and, where
appropriate, suggest areas where improvement would have significant impact.

Likewise, the GROW working group can be solicited by other working
groups (e.g., IDR or BESS) for the analysis of operational implications
of some solutions explored by these working groups on the routing
system (sustain the growth, stability, deployability, etc.).

Agenda time at GROW sessions at IETF meetings should allow for presentations
and discussions of operator issues and experience, and other work within scope for
the working group, but with a default expectation that priority be given
to operator presentations.

The current GROW working group objectives are:

* Present and discuss operational issues faced by the global routing system.
* Document common terminology relevant to the maintenance and operation
  of the global routing system.
* Document Best Current Practices for operations of the global routing system.
* Document the operational aspects of securing the Internet routing system.
* Provide guidance and recommendations for operating the global routing system.
* Standardize YANG data models related to the operations of global routing system.
*	Provide documentation to assist in preventing malpractice in the
  global routing system.
*	Determine the effect of IGP extensions on the stability of the global
  routing system.
* Provide maintenance for the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), including fixes,
  extensions, and future versions.
* Provide maintenance for the Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT)
  Routing Information Export Format.

SIDR operations related work will occur in SIDROPS working group.
