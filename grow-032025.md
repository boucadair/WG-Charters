The purpose of the GROW working group is to consider the operational problems
associated with the global IP routing system (both IPv4 and IPv6), including
but not limited to default-free zone routing table growth, forwarding tables
growth, effects of the interactions between interior and exterior routing protocols,
and effects of IPv4/IPv6 address allocation policies on the global routing system. 

The working group will document the operational aspects of measurement, monitoring,
policy, operational global routing system security, or safe
default behavior of global IP routing protocol implementations and deployments.
The GROW working group will also increase awareness to mitigations to prevent
malpractice (e.g., route leaks) in the global routing system.

The GROW working group will develop data models and building blocks
for automating the operation of the global routing system.

The GROW working group will collaborate with other working groups, primarily IDR working group,
that are developing solutions for the global IP routing system. When solicited, the working group
will review the solutions being developed for the global routing system by these other
working groups and provide inputs related to operational implications. The working group will also
provide inputs for addressing operational and routing security requirements of
Internet-connected networks, and, where appropriate, recommend work to be taken up by those working groups.
Likewise, the working group will solicit inputs for its chartered work from those other working groups
to strive for an optimal balance between objectives related to ease of operations and deployability,
sustain scaling, enhance robustness, and optimize performance.

Agenda time at GROW sessions at IETF meetings should allow for presentations
and discussions of operator issues and experience, and other work within scope for
the working group.

The current GROW working group objectives are:

* Present and discuss operational issues faced by the global routing system.
* Document common terminology relevant to the maintenance and operation
  of the global routing system.
* Document Best Current Practices for operations of the global routing system.
* Document the operational aspects of securing the Internet routing system.
* Provide guidance and recommendations for operating the global routing system.
* Standardize YANG data models and automation building blocks related
  to the operations of global routing system.
*	Provide documentation to assist in preventing malpractice in the
  global routing system.
*	Determine the effect of IGP extensions on the stability of the global
  routing system.
* Provide maintenance for the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), including fixes,
  extensions, and future versions.
* Provide maintenance for the Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT)
  Routing Information Export Format.

SIDR operations related work will occur in SIDROPS working group.
