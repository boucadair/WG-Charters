The MBONE Deployment (MBONED) Working Group is a forum for coordinating the
deployment, engineering, and operation of multicast routing protocols 
and procedures in the global Internet, inter-domain and single domain. The MBONED-WG 
is chartered to produce Standards Track, Informational, Best Current Practices, and Experimental RFCs.
This activity will include, but not be limited to:

- Document deployment of multicast routing in the global Internet.

- Receive regular reports on the current state of the deployment of
  multicast technology.

- Documents that capture the experience of those who have deployed and are deploying
  various multicast technologies.

- Develop and maintain mechanisms and procedures to address transport
  and security gaps inhibiting the deployment of multicast.

- Develop mechanisms and procedures for sharing operational information
  to aid in operation of the multicast backbones and interconnects.

- Develop and maintain tools and protocols that assist in multicast administration,
  diagnostics, troubleshooting, and deployment between/within native and 
  non-native environments (e.g., Mtrace and Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT)).

- Develop data models and other automation building blocks related
  to the operation of multicast services.
  
Development of routing protocols, forwarding-plane solutions and extensions, and group membership protocols is out of scope.

The working group may develop requirements and assist in review and 
feedback of documents in other working groups responsible for such 
protocols (e.g., PIM, BIER, and MOPS). Likewise, the working group will solicit inputs for its chartered work from other working groups (e.g., TSVWG, SAAG, and NETCONF).
