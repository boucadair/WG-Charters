The MBONE Deployment Working Group is a forum for coordinating the
deployment, engineering, and operation of multicast routing protocols 
and procedures in the global Internet, inter-domain, and single domain. 
This activity will include, but not be limited to:

- Document deployment of multicast routing in the global Internet.

- Receive regular reports on the current state of the deployment of 
multicast technology. Create "practice and experience" documents that 
capture the experience of those who have deployed and are deploying 
various multicast technologies.

- Based on reports and other information, provide feedback to other 
relevant working groups.

- Develop mechanisms and procedures for sharing operational information 
to aid in operation of the multicast backbones and interconnects.

- Develop tools, extend protocols and provide operational and 
implementation advice that assists in multicast administration, 
diagnostics, troubleshooting and deployment between/within native and 
non-native environments.

- Develop data models and other automation building blocks related
  to the operation of multicast services.
  
- Develop and maintain Mtrace.

Development of routing and group membership protocols is out of scope. 
This working group may develop requirements and assist in review and 
feedback of documents in other working groups responsible for such 
protocols.
