# Charter for Working Group

The IOTOPS Working Group is chartered for the discussion of operational issues related to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in particular related to device onboarding and lifecycle management.

IoT has a rather nebulous definition with different meanings for different people.

For the purposes of this WG, its focus is on devices that:

* are networked, either to the Internet or within limited administrative domains
* have a very limited end user interface or no end-user interface at all
* are deployed in sufficiently large numbers that they cannot easily be managed or maintained manually

The IETF works on a number of technologies related to IoT. This includes, but is not limited to work done in ACE, ANIMA, CBOR, CORE, DRIP, LAKE, ROLL, SUIT, TEEP, 6LO, and other working groups. IOTOPS is intended to be a discussion venue where people can discuss how various IoT-related technologies fit together.

IOTOPS provides a venue for IoT experts and other interested parties to engage in discussions of operational IoT requirements, as well as proposals for new uses of IP technology related to IoT devices and network operations.

Revision, updates, and extensions to work from existing WGs will be done in those WGs, except for
Standards Track / BCP work that focusses on IoT device lifecycle documents and related work as described below.
Where other new work may be needed, IOTOPS will help identify candidate venues within IETF for their development.

Standard track / BCP documents in the IOTOPS WG are restricted to:
- MUD solutions
- configuration backup and recovery solutions
- software/firmware upgrade solutions, focusing on discovery and distribution

Informational / BCP documents in the IOTOPS WG are restricted to:
1. Taking input and discussing issues related to the operational management of IoT devices.
This includes (but is not limited to):
- factory provisioning of devices
- onboarding of devices
- access control of devices to network resources
- administrative control of devices
- software/firmware upgrades
- isolation/quarantine of devices
- remediation of broken devices
- end of life management of devices
2. Taking input and discussing issues related to IoT operational security.
3. Publishing operational practices.
4. Documenting requirements and terminology.
