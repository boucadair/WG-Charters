# Charter for Working Group

The IOTOPS working group is chartered for the discussion of operational issues related
to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in particular related to device onboarding and lifecycle management.

IoT has a rather nebulous definition with different meanings for different people.

The IOTOPS working group focuses on devices that:

* are networked, either to the Internet or within limited administrative domains,
* have a very limited end-user interface or no end-user interface at all, and
* are deployed in sufficiently large numbers that they cannot easily be managed or maintained manually.

The IETF develops a number of technologies related to IoT. This includes, but is not limited to, work done in ACE,
ANIMA, CBOR, CORE, DRIP, LAKE, ROLL, SUIT, TEEP, 6LO, and other working groups. IOTOPS
is intended to be a venue to discuss how various IoT-related technologies fit together. Specifically, IOTOPS
provides a venue for IoT experts and other interested parties to
engage in discussions of operational IoT requirements, as well as approaches for new uses
of IP technology related to IoT devices and network operations.

Likewise, the IOTOPS working group welcome presentations from operators sharing issues and experience, and other work
within scope for the working group.

Revision, updates, and extensions to work from existing working groups will be done in those working groups, except for
Standards Track/BCP work that focuses on IoT device lifecycle documents and related work as described below.

Where other new work may be needed, IOTOPS will help identify candidate venues within the IETF for their development.

Standard track/BCP documents in the IOTOPS working group are restricted to:

- Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) solutions
- Configuration backup and recovery solutions
- Software/firmware upgrade solutions, focusing on discovery and distribution

Informational/BCP documents in the IOTOPS working group are restricted to:

1. Taking input and discussing issues related to the operational management of IoT devices.
This includes (but is not limited to):
- Factory provisioning of devices
- Onboarding of devices
- Access control of devices to network resources
- Administrative control of devices
- Software/firmware upgrades
- Isolation/quarantine of devices
- Remediation of broken devices
- End of life management of devices
2. Taking input and discussing issues related to IoT operational security.
3. Publishing operational practices and guidance.
4. Documenting requirements and terminology.
