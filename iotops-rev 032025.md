# Charter for Working Group

The IOTOPS working group is chartered for the discussion of operational issues related to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, in particular related to device onboarding and lifecycle management.

IoT has a rather nebulous definition with different meanings for different people.

The IOTOPS working group focuses on devices that:

* are networked, either to the Internet or within limited administrative domains,
* have a very limited end-user interface or no end-user interface at all, and
* are deployed in sufficiently large numbers that they cannot easily be managed or maintained manually.

The IETF defines a number of standards related to IoT, including, but not limited to, work produced by the ACE, ANIMA, CBOR, CORE, DRIP, LAKE, ROLL, SCHC, SUIT, TEEP, and 6LO working groups, among others.

IOTOPS serves as a forum to discuss how these various IoT-related technologies interoperate and align. Specifically, IOTOPS
provides IoT practitioners, operators, and other interested parties to engage in discussions around the operational requirements of IoT deployments. IOTOPS also explores emerging use cases and deployment models that may benefit from IP-based technologies in the context of IoT devices and networks.

Likewise, IOTOPS welcomes presentations from IoT operators, including service providers, enterprises, and other organizations deploying or managing large-scale IoT systems, who wish to share operational experience, challenges, and lessons learned, as well as other work within scope for the working group.

Revision, updates, and extensions to work from existing WGs will be done in those WGs.

Where other new work may be needed, IOTOPS will help identify candidate venues within the IETF for their development.

## Scope of Work

IOTOPS is chartered with the following scope:

* Standards Track and BCP Documents:

     - Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) solutions
     - Configuration backup and recovery solutions
     - Software/firmware upgrade solutions, focusing on discovery and distribution

* Informational and BCP Documents:

    - Documenting requirements and terminology.
    - Taking input and discussing issues related to the operational management of IoT devices. This includes (but is not limited to):

        + Factory provisioning of devices
        + Onboarding of devices
        + Access control of devices to network resources
        + Administrative control of devices
        + Software/firmware upgrades
        + Isolation/quarantine of devices
        + Remediation of broken devices
        + End of life management of devices

    - Taking input and discussing issues related to IoT operational security.
    - Publishing operational practices and guidance.
