As the ONIONS [charter](./onions.md) is being discussed, here is an initial list of relevant I-Ds and working groups that may be impacted. This is an early effort to assess potential effects and ensure the impact is appropriately socialised.

## Charter
|WG|Remarks|
|--|--|
|TEAS|Offload some of the abstraction work on data modelling to ONIONS (slicing applicability, VN, transport model, ACTN); TEAS can continue specify data models for the protocols/protocol extensions defined in TEAS|
|CCAMP|Offload data modelling abstraction work to ONIONS; CCAMP can continue specify data models for the protocols/protocol extensions defined in CCAMP|
|OPSAWG|Offload AC/SAP/LxNM to ONIONS; Future relevant work on abstractions will be directed to ONIONS|
|NMOP|Topology matters stay in NMOP|
