The V6OPS Working Group (WG) facilitates the universal deployment of IPv6. It will focus on both IPv6 deployment and IPv6 traffic growth.

## Objectives

*  Publish documents that demonstrate how IPv6 can be deployed in a specific environment, such as data centers, enterprise networks, WAN, access networks, etc.

*  Publish a study that compares the performance of existing IPv4 networks to the performance of existing IPv6 networks. When IPv6 networks do not perform as well as IPv4 networks, identify the root causes if possible.

*  Investigate and document use cases where dual-stack hosts prefer IPv4 or fail to utilize available IPv6 connectivity.

*  Publish documents that identify obstacles to IPv6 deployment. Each document should include an operational solution, if one is available.  These documents can be used as input to protocol-developing WGs.

*  Publish use cases, transition strategies, and best practices that enable IPv6-only operation.

*  Publish documents explaining IPv6's advantages over IPv4 (e.g., features that reduce operational complexity and improve reliability).

*  Maintain specifications of widely deployed transition mechanisms (including updating those published as Informational to Standards Track and Proposed Standard to Internet Standard). This includes NAT64, Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT), Explicit Address Mappings (EAM), and 464XLAT.

*  Publish documents summarizing requirements and defining best practices nodes, applications, and services adopting and operating over IPv6.

*  Maintain documents that the WG has published in the past.

*  Receive reports on network monitoring experiments and applications that perform well in IPv4 networks but do not perform well in IPv6 networks. A network monitoring experiment describes the externally observable behavior of the IPv6-enabled Internet. For example, it might report on the following:

      + The likelihood of a packet with a particular IPv6 extension header being delivered from end to end.
        
      + The likelihood of a packet with a long IPv6 extension header chain being delivered from end to end.
 
      + The likelihood of an IPv6 flow label being modified in transit.

## WG Practices

In order to achieve these goals, the WG will work with IPv6 Forum and the regional network operators' groups.  It will also interact with the HAPPY and SRV6OPS WGs, exchanging information and being mindful of each WG's charter.

The WG will continue to progress documents that it adopted prior to the adoption of this charter.

Occasionally, deployment issues will require protocol enhancements. Protocol enhancements are the responsibility of the WGs that developed the protocols, if such WGs are not concluded. However, the V6OPS WG may provide input to those WGs and cooperate with them in reviewing solutions to IPv6 deployment problems. In exceptional cases, the V6OPS WG may develop enhancements for IPv6 transition protocols, other than those listed above, via re-chartering.
