The global deployment of IPv6 is underway, creating an Internet consisting of IPv4-only, IPv6-only, IPv4-IPv6 dual-stack, and IPv6+translation networks and nodes. This deployment must be properly handled
to avoid the division of the Internet into separate IPv4 and IPv6 networks, ensuring addressing and connectivity for all IPv4 and IPv6 nodes. IPv6 deployment has resulted in the shutdown of IPv4 in some networks.
Removing IPv4 constraints has resulted in innovations in IPv6 network operations.

The IPv6 Operations Working Group (v6ops) develops guidelines for the deployment and operation of new and existing IPv6 networks.

The goals of the v6ops working group are:

1. Solicit input from network operators and users to identify operational issues with IPv6 networks, and determine solutions or workarounds to those issues.

1. Solicit input from network operators and users to identify operational interaction issues with the IPv4 networks, and determine solutions or workarounds to those issues.

1. Solicit discussion and documentation of the issues and opportunities in IPv6-only operation, and of the resulting innovations.

1. Operational solutions for identified issues should be developed in v6ops and documented in informational or BCP drafts.

1. Document operational requirements for IPv6 networks.

1. These documents should document IPv6 operational experience, including interactions with IPv4, in dual stack networks, IPv6 networks with IPv4 delivered as an overlay or translation service, or IPv6-only networks.

IPv6 operational and deployment issues with specific protocols or technologies (such as Applications, Transport Protocols, Routing Protocols, DNS or Sub-IP Protocols) are the primary responsibility of the
groups or areas responsible for those protocols or technologies. However, the v6ops Working Group may provide input to those areas/groups, as needed, and cooperate with those areas/groups in reviewing solutions
to IPv6 operational and deployment problems.

Future work items within this scope will be adopted by the Working Group only if there is a substantial expression of interest from the community and if the work clearly does not fit elsewhere in the IETF.

There must be a continuous expression of interest for the Working Group to work on a particular work item. If there is no longer sufficient interest in the Working Group in a work item, the item may be removed
from the list of Working Group items.
