The V6OPS Working Group (WG) facilitates the universal deployment of IPv6. It will focus on both IPv6 deployment and IPv6 traffic growth.

# Objectives

*  Publish documents that guide or demonstrate how IPv6 can be deployed in a specific environment such as data centers, enterprise networks, WAN, and access networks.

* Publish documents summarizing requirements and defining best practices for nodes, applications, and services adopting and operating over IPv6. 

* Publish a study that compares the performance of existing IPv4 networks to the performance of existing IPv6 networks.  When IPv6 networks do not perform as well as IPv4 networks, identify the root causes if possible.

* Publish documents that identify obstacles to IPv6 deployment. Each document should include an operational solution, if one is available.  These documents can be used as input to protocol-developing WGs.

* Publish use cases, migration strategies, and best practices that enable IPv6-only operation.

* Publish documents explaining IPv6's advantages over IPv4 (e.g., features that reduce operational complexity and improve reliability).

* Maintain specifications of widely deployed transition mechanisms (including updating those published as Informational to Standards Track and Proposed Standard to Internet Standard).

* Maintain documents that the WG has published in the past.

* Maintain a wiki page that includes a list of applications that perform well in IPv4 networks but do not perform well in IPv6 networks.

* Maintain several wiki pages that report on network monitoring experiments.  A network monitoring experiment describes the externally observable bhavior of the IPv6-enabled Internet. For example, it might report on the following:

    + The likelihood of a packet with a particular IPv6 extension header being delivered from end to end.
    + The likelihood of a packet with a long IPv6 extension header chain being delivered from end to end.
    + The likelihood of an IPv6 flow label being modified in transit.

* Develop educational resources that facilitate the universal deployment of IPv6. These might include preentations, FAQs, and other tools.

# WG Practices

In order to achieve these goals, the WG will work with the regional network operators' groups. It will also interact with the HAPPY and SRV6OPS WGs, exchanging information and being mindfull of each WG's charter.

The V6OPS WG will continue to progress documents that it adopted prior to the adoption of this charter.

Occasionally, deployment issues will require protocol enhancements. Protocol enhancements are the responsibility of the groups that developed the protocols. However, the V6OPS WG may provide input to those groups and cooperate with them in reviewing solutions to IPv6 deployment problems.

Future work items within this scope will be adopted by the WG only if there is a substantial expression of interest from the community and if the work clearly does not fit elsewhere in the IETF.

There must be a continuous expression of interest for the WG to work on a particular work item.  If there is no longer sufficient interest in the WG in a work item, the item may be removed from the list of WG items.
